# GEOINT Website Project

## Project Description
This website serves as the official digital presence for the Georgia State Defense Force (GSDF) GEOINT Section. Its primary purpose is to provide accurate and timely geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) for disaster response, emergency management, and operational planning.

The site includes pages that outline the organization's mission, available products and services (including custom map requests), team information, and resources. All content is structured to support ease of navigation, readability, and responsive use across devices.

## Features
- Homepage with quick links and announcements
- About Us section with mission overview and contact table
- Products & Services page with a dynamic request form
- Resources section for external materials and references
- Custom CSS styling for consistent design and mobile responsiveness
- Basic form integration with demo backend script
